This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
library(GGally)
str(mtcars)

data <- mtcars

data$trans <- ifelse(mtcars$am==0, "Auto", "Manual")
data <- data[, -9]

str(data)

ggpairs(mtcars)

fit.by.am <- lm(mpg~as.factor(am), data=mtcars)
summary(fit.by.am)

fit.by.all <- lm (mpg~., data=mtcars)
summary(fit.by.all)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
